IOT Application Preview




Each trigger gets updated in real time across all devices with the help of underlying technology called Websockets which is a bi-directional communication protocol. On click events the event trigger message would be sent to the other client IOT Devices whether it be a smart bulb or a smart fan. Not only would it turn on or off the device itâ€™ll also synchronously update the state of the buttons across all other client members using the app for better and consistent communication among all devices.
